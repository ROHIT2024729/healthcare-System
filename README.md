ZeeCare — HealthCare System
ZeeCare — Medical Institute is a full-stack MERN hospital management web application with built-in health-prediction functionality.
It provides user authentication, appointment booking, admin dashboard, and an ML-powered health prediction microservice — all designed to be practical, simple to run, and easy to extend.
This project is a responsive hospital website interface designed to showcase different medical departments and provide an easy way for visitors to get in touch. 
The Departments Section highlights major medical fields including Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Cardiology, and Neurology, each represented with a modern card-style layout and relevant images. 
The UI has been structured with clean visuals and bold typography to ensure clarity for patients and visitors browsing through various healthcare services. Beneath the departments, the design features a Contact Form titled “Send Us A Message” that includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, and Mobile Number, enabling patients or visitors to directly send inquiries or request consultations. 
The form layout is simple yet user-friendly, making it suitable for integration with backend services such as email handling or a hospital CRM system. Overall, the design focuses on creating a professional, trustworthy, and approachable digital presence for healthcare institutions, ensuring that users can both explore available medical services and quickly reach out for assistance.

The Appointment Form is a core feature of this hospital website, designed to simplify the process of scheduling medical consultations online. 
It provides patients with an easy-to-use interface where they can enter all the necessary details required to book an appointment with their preferred doctor. 
The form includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Mobile Number, NIC, Date of Birth, Gender, Appointment Date, Department Selection, Doctor Selection, and Address, ensuring that the hospital receives complete and accurate patient information. Dropdown options for Gender, Department, and Doctor make the selection process smooth, while date pickers for Date of Birth and Appointment Date provide a structured way of entering valid dates. 
This organized layout helps reduce errors, saves time for both patients and hospital staff, and enhances the overall patient experience. By integrating this form into the hospital website, visitors can conveniently request appointments from anywhere, eliminating the need for long phone calls or in-person scheduling, and allowing the hospital to manage appointments more efficiently.

The Health Prediction Form is an advanced feature of this hospital website that allows patients to input various medical parameters in order to predict potential health risks. 
This form is designed to gather crucial health-related data points such as Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina, Oldpeak (ST depression), Slope, Number of Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy, and Thalassemia status. 
Each field has been structured to ensure accurate and meaningful data entry, with dropdown menus for categorical values like Sex, Exercise Induced Angina, Slope, and Thalassemia, while numerical fields allow the patient to enter measurable values. 
Once the form is completed, patients can click on the Predict button, which can be connected to a machine learning model or backend logic that analyzes the inputs and provides a prediction related to heart disease or other cardiovascular risks. This feature helps patients get a quick health assessment online, offering valuable insights before consulting a doctor. By integrating this form, hospitals can empower patients with early health predictions, encourage preventive care, and support doctors with pre-collected patient information for better diagnosis.
